\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

This work presents a new consistency model, \mdllong{}, a
modern extension of linearizability that explicitly allows
client processes to issue multiple operations concurrently.
We also describe how
to transform applications that currently interact with 
a linearizable system into ones that can reap the performance
benefits offered by a comparable \mdl{} system. We prove that
following the transformation ensure the new application will 
behave the same as the old. Further, we design, implement,
and evaluate \sys{}, the first
multi-shard system to guarantee \mdl{}. Our evaluation 
demonstrates \sys{} offers significant (e.g., up to 75\%) 
reductions in end-to-end application latency.
