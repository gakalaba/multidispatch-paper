  \begin{itemize}
    \item Does MD linearizability offer apps significantly lower e2e latency for realistic workloads compared to baselines?
      \subitem How well does MD linearizabilityâ€™s performance scale as we vary the number shards, clients, outstanding requests per client, contention factor, and inter-shard distance?
    \item What kinds of applications/styles of programming benefit from MD linearizability and in what ways? How usable is MD linearizability?
    \item What are the system limitations and deployment costs? At what point does the system start to degrade?
    \item What additional cost do we pay for the correctness guarantees? What is the overhead that is added to MD-lin over a hypothetical 1/N factor speedup? How fast is MD-lin when a user behaves sequentially?
