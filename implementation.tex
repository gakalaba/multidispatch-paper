\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

We implemented \mdl within the EPaxos framework by modifying the existing implementation of \mpaxos. Our prototype implements a key-value store and consists of 2800 lines of Golang code, not including the testing framework. Our code and experimental scripts are available online ~\cite{code22}. 
% Should the LoC be total or the number of added LOC to existing multi-paxos?


Since \sdl is composable, the unmodified \mpaxos clients submit requests to the leader of a single shard. We extend the clients to issue requests to multiple shard leaders. Clients keep track of a per-shard sequence number, and when requests are concurrent, they include a nonempty dependency set consisting of the previously submitted outstanding requests.
