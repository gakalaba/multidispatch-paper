  Linearizability is the gold standard consistency model, guaranteeing that operations execute in a total global order across all clients in a manner that respects real-time. Application programmers who build atop linearizable systems experience easy-to-reason-about sequential behavior, almost
  as if they were programming on a single machine. But even linearizability introduces a trade-off for application
  programmers: It requires that client processes dispatch only one operation at a time and await its response before issuing the next. This constraint can significantly increase a complex
  application's end-to-end latency. But clients that do not behave sequentially (e.g., to get lower latency) are not guaranteed a linearizable ordering over their operations, breaking linearizability's easy-to-reason-about semantics.
  
  In this paper, we introduce \Multidispatch{} Linearizability (\md{}), a new consistency model that extends Linearizability 
  to explicitly allow individual clients to issue concurrent operations. Removing this constraint in \md{} improves application latency while guaranteeing a linearization that respects each client's issue order. To demonstrate this, we also design, implement, and evaluate \sys{}, the first multi-shard system to guarantee \md{}. We demonstrate \sys{} can reduce application latency by up to 75\%.
